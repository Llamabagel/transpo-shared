# Transpo-Shared
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dellisd/transpo-shared.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dellisd/transpo-shared)

A library of shared data classes, interfaces, and interface implementations used across Route 613 components.
These classes are used in the [server](https://github.com/dellisd/transpo-server), [Android app](https://github.com/dellisd/Transpo), 
and data management tools (to be written).

Currently needs to be included as a git submodule in each project, but eventually we hope to set it up to be included as
a jar dependency.
